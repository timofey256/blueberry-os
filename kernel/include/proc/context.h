/**
 * CPU context
 *
 * This context structure is used for switching between threads in the
 * kernel. We could save all the registers, but most of them have been
 * already saved on the stack by the compiler.
 *
 * This is because the RISC-V ABI mandates that a function only needs
 * to preserve the callee-saved temporaries ($s1-$11), the stack pointer
 * ($sp), and the frame pointer ($fp, which is also considered $s0 in case
 * a function does not use a frame pointer). We also need to preserve
 * the return address ($ra). Preserving other registers across a
 * function call is the responsibility of the caller.
 *
 * From the perspective of the C compiler, context switch is just a
 * function call, so if the compiler wants to preserve registers other
 * than those listed, it must save them on the stack before the call.
 * This also holds for all callers higher up in the call stack.
 *
 * We also save the 'sstatus' CSR to preserve the interrupt-processing
 * state for each thread.
